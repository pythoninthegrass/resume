resume_header_intro: "<p>Employed at very large and small companies alike. Former VP of HR once paid me the compliment: “You’re the most normal IT guy I’ve ever worked with.” Frequently balance technical matters with authority while leveling with other colleagues in language they can relate to. Often drop everything to make sure co-workers are taken care of – whether that’s the CEO or an intern, each person matters and deserves respect. Minimizing downtime is a large part of that but making connections that persist past nine to five and through the years is what I strive for.</p>"
